# Covid_First_Wave

The pandemic resulting from the novel SARS-Cov-2 virus has been an unprecedented event, having dire consequences for the health and economies of countries on a global scale. As we now know the virus operates in cyclical patterns of infection known as waves, it is important to study the nature of these epidemiological events using trusted statistical methods. In this analysis, we focus on the first wave of Coronavirus in 5 countries. This aggregation is important, as we have now seen that the heterogeneity of initial response and policies put in place by individual countries has caused extremely different trajectories in terms of disease spread and virological evolution.
